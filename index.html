            <p>
               I (Tracy Pham) am working with Mary Duong. We are creating a platform game where each platform is a "pipe",
                and the player's character must progress in the game by jumping on top of the pipes. 
                If the character falls in between the pipes, they will die and its game over. If they make it to the end, 
                they win. The character will be controlled by an audio input, via the player's microphone. No input is no 
                movement. Low volume is moving forward, and high volume is jumping.

         <h2>Progress Plan</h2>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>One of our milestone is to learn how to use WebGL and how to use P5.js voice processing. Another milestone is to create the game itself, then implement voice control to move the player through the game.
                We have not started yet, so we can't describe our progress made to date or difficulties we have at the moment of writing this progress report.

                    <li>1. Learning the libraries and syntax</li>
                    <li>2. Incorporating what we've learned in class while still using the voice processing library</li>
                    <li>3. Getting the p5.js library to work</li>
