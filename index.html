         <h2>Progress Plan</h2>
         <div class="textbox">
            <p>One of our milestone is to learn how to use WebGL and how to use P5.js voice processing. Another milestone is to create the game itself, then implement voice control to move the player through the game.
                We have not started yet, so we can't describe our progress made to date or difficulties we have at the moment of writing this progress report.
