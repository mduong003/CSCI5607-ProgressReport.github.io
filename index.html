               I (Tracy Pham) am working with Mary Duong. We are creating a platform game where each platform is a "pipe",
                and the player's character must progress in the game by jumping on top of the pipes. 
                If the character falls in between the pipes, they will die and its game over. If they make it to the end, 
                they win. The character will be controlled by an audio input, via the player's microphone. No input is no 
                movement. Low volume is moving forward, and high volume is jumping.
